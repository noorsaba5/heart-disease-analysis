Predicting heart disease using statistical analysis and machine learning
# Heart Disease Prediction Using Data Science

## Overview
This project analyzes clinical data from patients evaluated for heart disease and applies statistical analysis and machine learning techniques to identify key risk factors and predict disease presence.

The dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (Cleveland Clinic Foundation subset).

## Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis and hypothesis testing
- Identify statistically significant predictors of heart disease
- Build and compare predictive models
- Communicate insights through visualizations, presentation, and poster

## Dataset
- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
- Records: 297 patients (after cleaning)
- Features: 13 clinical attributes
- Target: Heart disease presence (binary)

## Methodology
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Hypothesis testing (t-test, chi-square, Mann–Whitney U)
- Predictive modeling:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
- Model evaluation using accuracy and ROC-AUC

## Key Findings
- Chest pain type, ST depression, age, and exercise capacity are strong predictors
- Random Forest achieved better predictive performance
- Logistic Regression provided interpretability through odds ratios
